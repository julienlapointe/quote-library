### What will the application do?

Quote Qatalogue is a desktop Java application that allows users to 
store, edit, delete, sort, categorize, and view their favorite quotes.

### Who will use it?

People who enjoy collecting quotes from famous people and others. 

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy collecting quotes, 
but I don't have a tool for organizing and viewing them. I currently 
have a long list of quotes in the Apple Notes app. 

### What are the user stories?

- As a user, I want to be able to add a quote (along with the author 
and tags) to my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a quote in my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a quote from my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to sort quotes by date added, as well as 
alphabetically by quote, author, and tag. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view my quotes individually, displayed
randomly from my entire library or from a particular author or tag.

- As a user, I want to be able to create a playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a quote to multiple playlists.
