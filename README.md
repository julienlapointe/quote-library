# Quote Library

### What will the application do?

Quote Library is a desktop Java application that allows users to organize and 
view their favorite quotes.

### Who will use it?

Users are people who enjoy reading and collecting quotes, whether from famous 
people or anonymous authors. 

### Why is this project of interest to you?

I am building Quote Library because I enjoy collecting quotes, but I don't have a 
tool for **organizing** and **viewing** them. I currently use my Apple Notes app 
to store a long list of quotes, but they are locked in reverse chronological order 
by date added so I rarely see old quotes again.  

### What are the user stories?

- As a user, I want to be able to **add** a quote (along with the author) to my 
library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **edit** a quote in my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **remove** a quote from my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **view** all my quotes in a list.
