# "Quoterrific"

### What will the application do?

"Quoterrific" is a desktop Java application that allows users to 
add, edit, delete, sort, search, and view their favorite quotes.

### Who will use it?

"Quoterrific" will be used by people who enjoy collecting and reading 
quotes, whether from famous people or anonymous authors. 

### Why is this project of interest to you?

"Quoterrific" is of interest to me because I enjoy collecting quotes, 
but I don't have a tool for **organizing** and **viewing** them. I currently 
use my Apple Notes app to store a long list of quotes, but they are locked 
in reverse chronological order by date added so I rarely see old quotes.  

### What are the user stories?

- As a user, I want to be able to **add** a quote (along with the author 
and tags) to my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **edit** a quote in my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **delete** a quote from my library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **sort** quotes by date added, as well as 
alphabetically by quote, author, and tag. 
- As a user, I want to be able to **search** my library for quotes, authors, 
and tags.
- As a user, I want to be able to **view** my quotes individually for a set 
time (like a carousel), displayed *randomly* from my entire library or from 
a particular author or tag.
